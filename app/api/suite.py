"""
app/api/suite.py — pktHub integration endpoints.

Token flow (new):
  1. pktApp generates a random suite_token on first call to GET /api/suite/token
  2. Admin copies the token from Settings → Integrations → Suite Integration
  3. Admin pastes the token into pktHub App Manager when registering this app
  4. pktHub stores it and sends it as X-Suite-Token on every proxied request

GET  /api/suite/token    — returns current token (generates one if not set)
POST /api/suite/register — stores a new token (manual override)
GET  /api/suite/whoami   — authenticated identity check; a sibling pkt* app's
                           "Test Connection" button calls this (not the public
                           /api/health) so a wrong/revoked token fails the test
                           instead of silently reporting a healthy connection.

Managed mode — pktHub forcing every user through the hub:

GET   /api/suite/direct-access   — lock state, for pktHub's pre-flight
POST  /api/suite/direct-access   — lock/unlock, sent by pktHub
GET   /api/suite/mode            — same state, unauthenticated, for our own UI
PATCH /api/suite/hub-redirect-url — where locked users are sent
